# This is the implicit global project's config file, which is only used when
# 'stack' is run outside of a real project. Settings here do _not_ act as
# defaults for all projects. To change Stack's default settings, edit
# '/home/pgujjula/.config/stack/config.yaml' instead.
#
# For more information about Stack's configuration, see
